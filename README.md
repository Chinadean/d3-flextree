# To do

* More tests. Try to do a fairly exhaustive one. Also, do some from the
  papers.
* Make some blocks to show off the difference between tree and flextree:
    * [Collapsible Tree](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4339083)

* Also update the wiki documentation - I already forked it to my fork of d3's wiki.

* Pull-request. Things to mention:
    * Cleaned up the way size and nodeSize is handled.


* Also create it as a plugin, named flextree.
    * Squash all commits
    * Can I write a sed script that will create it out of d3/src/layout/tree.js
      (and others)?
